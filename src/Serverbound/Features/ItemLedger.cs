		An account, per character, of the items that lock progress: what it got on this server and what it
		put back into the world. A vanilla client never shows the server its bag, but nearly every way into
		and out of a bag passes through an object the server sees.

		In:
		- picking an item up: the player takes the item over and deletes it (DestroyZDO from that player);
		- taking it out of a chest, cart, ship or tombstone: the player who has the container open sends its
		  new contents.
		Out:
		- dropping it: a new item from that player that has been in a bag before. Player.OnInventoryChanged
		  marks everything in a bag as picked up, and an item that falls out of a destroyed piece, a creature
		  or a rock does not carry the mark;
		- putting it into a container, on an item stand or an armor stand;
		- feeding it to a smelter, kiln, refinery, cooking station or fermenter, or offering it at a boss
		  altar -- those calls reach the server, which owns these objects near players;
		- building with it (a new piece the player created) and dying with it (a tombstone is the whole bag).
		Seen as it is used, not as it moves:
		- what a character wears and holds, checked every few seconds; an upgrade shows as a higher quality.
		Not seen: crafting, upgrading, eating, buying from a trader, what a caught fish brings along. A
		tracked item a character has not got here counts as crafted by it if its recipe can be paid from the
		tracked items it did get (the untracked ingredients are assumed at hand), and a craft counts as
		yielding the most it can: the crafting bonus at its luckiest, the best ingredient of a one-of recipe.
		An upgrade may have been made at Valheim 1.0's upgrade station, which takes only upgrader items, and
		an item held may have broken there and handed part of its materials back. A caught fish counts in
		the most its extra drops can bring. What traders sell is not tracked. An item the game removes
		after an hour with nobody near is no pickup.

		An item that falls out of a container, item stand or armor stand its owner destroyed or emptied has
		been in a bag, but not in this player's: drops from the same player shortly after such an event are
		matched against it first. New drops wait a moment for that.

		When a character puts more of an item into the world than it ever got here, nor could make, the rest
		came from another world. That is written to the guard log; with Mode = On it is also taken away --
		a dropped stack is cut down, a container or stand loses it once nobody is using it, a station ignores
		it, a boss altar refuses to summon with it -- and the player is told. What was built with it or is
		worn is only logged. What is unexplained is never counted as got.

		The account is exact only when what the character carried at the start is known: a new, fresh
		character that starts at zero (see CharacterGuard), or any character after its first death here,
		when the tombstone shows the whole bag. Until then its findings are logged as unverified and never
		acted on. For the first GraceHours after the ledger is switched on, no character counts as new: the
		players who are already around come back with what they had.
