		A dungeon whose room bundle Unity refuses to load never spawns, and its zone stays flagged as
		loading for good. In the game's asset loader (SoftReferenceableAssets, Valheim 1.0.15):

		- Unity refuses a bundle with "another AssetBundle with the same files is already loaded"
		  and hands back no bundle; BundleLoader.OnLoadAsyncCompleted stores that null and still
		  reports the load as succeeded;
		- AssetLoader.OnBundleLoadCompleted then calls LoadAssetFromBundleAsync, which dereferences
		  the null bundle and throws;
		- so the asset's callbacks never run, DungeonGenerator.OnRoomLoaded never hears back, the
		  dungeon never spawns and ZoneSystem keeps its zone in m_loadingObjectsInZones.

		A vanilla dedicated server never instantiates dungeons near players, so it never gets there.
		This mod does, for every player, all day. Seen on a 1.0.15 Linux server as an endless loop
		over the same two dungeons (ddormer/valheim-serverside#120).

		Three guards, each of which does nothing unless that failure happens:
		1. OnLoadAsyncCompleted without a bundle: take the bundle Unity says is already loaded, the
		   same one under the same name, or report the load as failed if there is none.
		2. LoadAssetFromBundleAsync without a bundle: report the asset as failed instead of throwing.
		3. OnRoomLoaded with a failed room: let the dungeon go -- no spawn, its rooms and its zone
		   released -- so the zone keeps working and the dungeon is tried again the next time it is
		   created. Skipped when an earlier prefix already handled it (ValheimCommunityPatch has its
		   own fix for this callback, which then spawns the dungeon without the missing room).
